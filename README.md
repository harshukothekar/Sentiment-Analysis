Sentiment Analysis &amp; Rating Prediction for Customer Reviews
In this project I have analyzed customer reviews in the form of text comment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for hotel businesses and build a model which can predict ratings of the customers based on their reviews and also classify sentiments as positive, negative and average. I have used various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to improve accuracy. Sentiment classification and rating prediction have been manually tested, and the results were astounding.
